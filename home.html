						<p>The purpose of this website is to gather information surrounding the book of Abraham:
						it’s origins, it’s doctrinal offerings, what scholars both LDS and non-LDS have said
						regarding its historicity, and brief explanations of the basic people and places surrounding
						the book’s origin.<br></p>
	
						<p>Our intent is not to create an exhaustive compilation of this information or a scholarly
						analysis of the book of Abraham and its origins, rather our site is to be used simply as a resource
						for finding reliable information and to create a good starting place for honest seekers of
						the truth to begin their own search. We aim to provide brief summaries of available information,
						written from a perspective of faith in the divine calling of Joseph Smith and of the scripture
						he brought to light.</p>

					<h5 class="s_heading">Joseph Smith</h3>
						The founder of the church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and the related movements of Mormonism was born in Vermont in 1805 and martyred in Illinois in 1844. Followers of Joseph Smith as well as the modern Latter Day Saint movement believe Joseph to be a prophet who restored the true church of Christ to the earth in the 19th century.
						After founding the church in 1830 in Fayette, New York, Joseph Smith and its members would eventually relocate to Kirtland, Ohio where he would attain the papyri from Michael Chandler.  It wasn’t until the saints resided in Nauvoo that his translations of these papyri, or the revelation he referred to as the book of Abraham, was first published in the Times and Seasons—a newspaper in Nauvoo.
				</p>
	
				<p id="antonio" class="support">
					<h5 class="s_heading">Antonio Lebolo</h3>
					A former cavalryman in the Italian army who became an antiquities excavator for the French Consul-General of Egypt in the early 1800’s. He oversaw many excavations and in the process found a number of mummies and some artifacts in a tomb near the ancient city of Thebes. He kept a number of these mummies and artifacts for himself. These were added to his already sizeable private collection. Four of these mummies were later shown to Joseph Smith and papyri accompanying them were the basis for the translation of the book of Abraham.
				</p>
	
				<p id="michael" class="support">
					<h5 class="s_heading">Michael Chandler</h3>
					Born in Ireland about 1797. Married Frances Ludlow in 1819. They had six children. Moved to the United States in 1827. It is unclear how, but he became the owner of 11 mummies and accompanying artifacts that were sent to New York three years after Lebolo’s death (sometime around February 1833). Some accounts say Chandler claimed to be Lebolo’s nephew though there are no records to support this relation. Lebolo’s will was found in 1984 and makes no mention of him.
					Chandler showed the mummies across various states in the following years and eventually heard of Joseph Smith, who was rumored to be able to translate Egyptian. In 1835 members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints purchased 4 mummies and papyri from Chandler. It was these papyri that were used in the book of Abraham translation.
				</p>
	
				<p id="abraham" class="support">
					<h5 class="s_heading">Abraham</h3>
					From the book of Genesis, married to Sarah and father of Isaac and Ishmael. Abraham is an important figure in the beliefs of Christians, Jews and Muslims. The book of Abraham is a revelation of Joseph Smith from writings on ancient papyri. This revelation details events of Abraham’s life not found in the Bible.
				</p>
	
				<p id="boa" class="support">
					<h5 class="s_heading">The Book of Abraham</h3>
					Joseph Smith’s translation of the writings of Abraham that he found on papyri which he purchased from Michael Chandler in 1835. The book was canonized by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints along with other revelations as a collection titled the Pearl of Great Price and is an often used and referenced scripture in the Church today.

					<h5 class="s_heading">Faith Promoting Articles</h3>
					Part of our mission is to help people examine the book of Abraham with an eye of faith. Since much of the information dealing with the subject is controversial or aimed at debunking Joseph Smith as a prophet, we believe this approach has merit in presenting both sides of the argument. Here are links to some devotional articles or speeches, written by leaders of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to inspire faith in Church members. For those members of the Church who may be struggling in their search for the truth, we hope this will give them additional encouragement in their studies. For those who are not members of the Church, we believe this can be useful insight in understand how Mormons view the book of Abraham and its importance.

					<h5 class="s_heading">Further Information</h3>
					Our most highly recommended sources for faith promoting and scholarly information are both backed by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The gospel topics essay, “Translation and Historicity of the Book of Abraham”, is an excellent summary of information surrounding the origin of the book of Abraham viewed through a lens of faithfulness, and it’s sources are also recommended. The Joseph Smith Papers are a effort to gather all of the known papers of Joseph Smith. The site has a collection of papers relating to the translation of the book of Abraham where the actual documents have been scanned, are viewable and have also been transcribed into modern reader-friendly typed text.
