                  The account of the creation found in the book of Abraham differs in many significant ways from the creation account found in Genesis. In the Genesis account the creation is broken into 7 “days”, but the book of Abraham uses the term “time” instead, which many Latter-day Saints view as more congruent with the view of creative periods of an indeterminate length of time.
                  Perhaps most notable is the book's treatment of the people involved in creation. The creation story in the book of Abraham refers to the gods, a plural group, as being involved in the creation of the Earth. Latter-day Saints view this as congruent with our belief in a godhead comprised of individual beings, and some interpret these verses to refer to other beings (God’s children) assisting God the Father in creation.
