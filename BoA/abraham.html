                <h1>Relation to the Life of Abraham</h1>
                <p>
                        While there was little historical evidence that related to Abraham's life in the time of Joseph Smith,
                        much has been discovered in our time. It is interesting to compare the revalations in the book of Abraham
                        to the recent discoveries about Abraham's life. There are many similarities of note, especially those relating
                        to pagan worship in Mesopotamia and Abraham's travels into Egypt. It should be noted that there may be
                        incongruencies as well. Regardless, a view of modern evidence of Abraham's life can help readers better understand
                        the book of Abraham, as well as draw conclusions about its authenticity. The links below will point readers in
                        the right direction.
