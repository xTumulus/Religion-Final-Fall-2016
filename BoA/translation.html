                <h1>Translation</h1>
                <p class="article">
                  The translation of the book of Abraham resulted in three interpretations of illustrations known as “facsimiles” and five chapters of scripture detailing parts of Abraham’s life and some visions experienced by Abraham. It was translated by Joseph Smith from 1835-1842.
                  It is important to understand what Joseph Smith meant when he used the word translation. For instance, when Joseph Smith produced what he called a translation of the Bible, he made additions (some minor, some the size of several chapters), grammatical changes and clarifications. When he said translation, Joseph was not referring to a translation in the traditional sense but rather revelatory corrections and clarifications. He did not reference original manuscripts or apply a study of Hebrew and Greek in order to translate these documents; rather, his changes were made based purely on revelation.
                  While Joseph did have actual papyri which he used in the translation of the book of Abraham, it is unclear exactly what role the papyri played in the translation. Joseph did not claim to know the ancient languages he interpreted but instead wrote according to inspiration he received. Because records of the translation process are lacking and because little of the original scrolls remains intact, it is difficult to draw definitive conclusions. Some believe that Joseph did not make a literal translation but that he may have used these documents as a source of inspiration to receive revelation that may not actually have been present on the documents themselves. Others hold that the book of Abraham is in fact a literal translation of a document relating to Abraham’s life.
