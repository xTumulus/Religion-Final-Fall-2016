                  In 1839-1846 Mormons following Joseph Smith were gathered in the city of Nauvoo, Illinois. In 1842 The Times and Seasons, the church’s newspaper in Nauvoo, periodically published what is now known as the book of Abraham. Though these articles were known to the church, they were not canonized by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints until 1880.
