                <p class="article">
                  Often seen as a very peculiar object in the uniquely Mormon cannon, kolob is the star nearest to the throne of God. While much speculation has been generated around kolob and its literal meaning/location, the most agreed upon interpretation of these kolob is as an analogy for Christ and his position nearest to the God the Father as being on the right-hand of God. Those outside the church are often drawn to the idea of Kolob as symbol of Mormonismâ€™s bizarre departure from traditional Christian belief, but Latter-day Saints often place less importance on this one particular analogy for Christ than detractors of Mormonism.
