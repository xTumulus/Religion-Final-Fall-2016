                  Abraham chapter 3 often stands out even among the varied doctrinal offerings in the book of Abraham. In it, the Lord reveals to Abraham certain principles relating to astronomy and the nature of the universe. Abraham is told of the stars and planets which the Lord has created and how they relate to the throne of God. Then the Lord relates them to the intelligences that existed before the Earth and their relationship to God. No interpretation of this will be attempted here but those with questions are directed to the text of Abraham 3 and the sources below.
