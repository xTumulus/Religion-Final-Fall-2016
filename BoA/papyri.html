                <h1>The Mummies and Papyri</h1>
                <p class="article">
                  Between 1817 and 1821 Antonio Lebolo, an italian adventurer, found a group of mummies and assorted artifacts in a tomb in Sheikh Abd el-Qurna Egypt. Much of what was found was sold to collectors and museums, though Lebolo kept some mummies and artifacts for himself.
                  Lebolo died sometime around February 1830. After his death, his possessions ended up in New York and were obtained by Michael H. Chandler. Chandler began traveling through the states and displayed the mummies and papyri in a traveling exhibit. His exhibit came to Kirtland Ohio in 1835 with four mummies and a few papyrus scrolls remaining. Joseph Smith visited the exhibit and said that he recognized some of the papyri as writings of Abraham and wished to obtain them for the purpose of translation. Chandler refused to sell the papyri separate from the mummies, so a group of Latter-day Saints paid for the remaining artifacts.
                  The mummies went to the home of Lucy Mack Smith, Joseph’s mother, where she charged patrons to view them. The papyri went into Joseph Smith’s possession and were used in the translation of the book of Abraham.
